- **Melody**: The drawing direction of your magic influences the melody.
- **Rhythm**: The amount of time you wait between each part of your magic affects the rhythm.

Remember, the more imaginative and inventive your magic is, the more your flying capability improves. So, let your creativity flow and craft amazing sceneries with vibrant colors!
