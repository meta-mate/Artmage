## How to Play

As a magician, you have the power to place or remove blocks and change their colors using your magic. The magic you create should be both creative melodically and rhythmically.

- **Melody**: The drawing direction of your magic influences the melody.
- **Rhythm**: The amount of time you wait between each part of your magic affects the rhythm.

Remember, the more imaginative and inventive your magic is, the more your flying capability improves. So, let your creativity flow and craft amazing sceneries with vibrant colors!

Enjoy playing ColorMage!
