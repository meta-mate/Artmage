If ur on PC
  wasd is for walking and flying
  arrows for drawing magic
  space to apply magic

On phone you have joysticks on each side, and the spacebar is the creativity bar

You are a magician
You have to make cool and creative stuff with your magic

The cooler you make it the more you fuel up ur flying capability

With magic you place or remove blocks, and change their color

The goal is to get higher, as the world is incrementally disappearing below you
Also to make cool sceneries with colors!

Ur magic has to be creative melodically and rhytmically

  Melody is tied to the drawing direction
  Rhythm is the amount of ticks you wait between each part of magic
